title: Open ISOBUS Database
date: 2013-11-19
excerpt: A [central place](/traces.html "Central Place") to share ISOBUS message logs.
---
Since pretty much everyone else out there is going to have the same problem of
not knowing which ISOBUS messages are present on which machines, we're going to
start an open, public database of ISOBUS messages from as many machines as we
can find.
      
You can find the first few files [here](/traces.html "Traces").  If anyone else
out there has similar information for any of their machines and would like to
share, please [email us](mailto:info@isoblue.org "Email ISOBlue") and we'll put
it up with the rest.
