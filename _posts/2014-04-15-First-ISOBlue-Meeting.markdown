The first ISOBlue meeting will take place April 29, 2014 at Purdue University in West Lafayette.  We plan to demonstrate 
the newly working RTK GPS functionality and a demo yield monitor Android app showcasing new buffering capabilities.

The goal of the meeting is to prioritize the next steps for ISOBlue and identify funding for future 
development.  Some possible future paths include:

* An open-source environmental telemetry station that can sample a wide array of sensors and send that information
directly to the cloud.
* A custom, open source hardware cape for the BBB that integrates a cellular modem and the NVS RTK GPS unit to
make a fully self-contained telematics unit.
* Continued software development for the ISOBlue libraries.
* And any more new ideas that may come up.

If you are interested in attending, please [send us a quick email](mailto:info@isoblue.org) to RSVP so we can plan ahead.
