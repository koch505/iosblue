As mentioned in [our previous post][2014-04-14-RTK-GPS-Under-00-Works], we have gotten RTK GPS
working on ISOBlue with an [NVS NV08C-CSM-BRD](http://www.nvs-gnss.com/products/receivers/item/36-nv08c-csm-brd.html) receiver
which only costs about $64 for an evaluation board.  

Here is a first draft of the instructions outlining how to get it working for youself:
[in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZN-PDSLv6FeCkA-adjLOpmdcVy0tsadxfFJ8-xAOVs/edit?pli=1).

Please [send us feedback](mailto:info@isoblue.org) if you work on getting this going yourself
and are able to help clarify any confusing points for future fellow travelers.
