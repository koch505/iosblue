Data Collection from October 29, 2013
=====================================

Each of the files in this directory that end with ".db" are simple SQLite database
files.  You can read a SQLite database file using the sqlite command-line shell
found [here](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

These files were copied directly from the SD card on an Android tablet which was running
the ISOBlue demo app.
