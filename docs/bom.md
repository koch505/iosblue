### Cellular Module Selection

The cellular module we picked is a [Telit LE910-NAG][2]. It is a module that
only supports AT&T network. The [LE910 family][3] has alternative modules that
offer support for multiple cellular providers. Please check the data coverage
of the area you want to deploy your device for picking the correct cellular
module. Note that you also need a cellular data plan and a SIM card to ensure
network connectivity.
