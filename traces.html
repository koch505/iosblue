        <h1>ISOBUS Message Logs</h1>
        <p>We'll be posting all our raw ISOBUS message logs here, with information about the 
        tractor and situation they came from.  Please <a href="mailto:info@isoblue.org">send us your log files</a>
        and we'll post them here for fellow travelers.</p>
        <p>In the near future, we're going to turn this into a query-able database.  For now, we'll post files
        here while we get a better handle on the metadata we'll have available to identify various traces.</p>

            Each of the files in this zipfile that end with ".db" are simple SQLite database
            files.  You can read a SQLite database file using the sqlite3 command-line shell
            found <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">here</a>. These files were copied 
            directly from the SD card on an Android tablet which was running the ISOBlue demo app.

            These files were all collected from a 2011 Case 6088 combine.  The filenames indicate
            the special condition under which each was collected.  They mean:
            <ul>
              <li>isobus_messages-173-bu.db: the total bushels logged by the calibrated combine monitor during
                  this run was 173.</li>

              <li>isobus_messages-94-bu.db: the total bushels logged by the calibrated combine monitor during
                  this run was 94.</li>
              
              <li>isobus_messages-moist-un.db: the moisture sensor was unplugged from the CAN bus during

              <li>isobus_messages-moist-re.db: the moisture sensor was plugged back in to the CAN bus during
                  this run.</li>
              
              <li>isobus_messages-yield-un.db: the yield sensor was unplugged from the CAN bus during
